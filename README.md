# Timer
Simple timer extension for Chrome.

## Todo
### Urgent
- MAKE TIMER WORK IN BACKGROUND
- Make timer reusable (currently breaks after it finishes)
- Fix bug which incorrectly converts time (e.g. "1h30m0s" is displayed as "1h29m60s")
# Less urgent
- Add a pause timer button
- Add a reset timer button
- Store previously used time
- Option for favourite times?
